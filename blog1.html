        How is student's life? (for our society)
    </h3>

    <p>
        A student’s life is a foundation for learning. A student has to face all types of situations and is trained for the future. They learn to obey, respect and discipline themselves. They get to mingle with other students and teachers. A child’s character
        is shaped during this period. School life is the best and happiest part of every student. They live with no worries and tensions about the future. They play, make friends, learn skills, and live life to the fullest. It is the school where discipline
        is formed. They learn to be punctual, follow rules, and perform duties. Most importantly, they acquire knowledge and develop new skills in them. The training from the school life is what makes students turn into better personalities. Student life
        is the most valuable part in which teachers and parents guide them in the right way and allow them to know what is good and bad for life.

        How is student's life in reality?
    </h3>

    <p>A student's life is a foundation for mugging up things. A student has to face all kinds of situations for being successful in life but they have not been trained for the failures in life. Thats why many student's suicide and they see it as a last
        option after failure. But most important thing is to teach student's about or what to do after failure rather than teaching them about success because failure appear's more of time's than success. School life is the best and happiest part of every
        student, not because they have learned to obey, respect, etc, it is because of the bond student's make with another student's, teacher's, and every other people who have been the part of their life. People think student's have no worries and tensions
        about future which is absolutely a myth. Have you ever seen face's of student's before their result's, that are the most pitiful face's people can ever see. School think's that student's are learner but they always treat student's as a learning
        machine's We don't need no education, we don't need no thought control, We don't need dark sarcasm in the classroom. All in all it is just another brick in the wall. Every one say's study 10th exams are the last after that you can enjoy but after
        that more tough thing's take's place. Which stream to choose, on which our future depends and most important thing is that we never have been taught what is there in it. So we bifurcate or give priority by percent. When student's ask for some
        kind of guidance they get more confused. If you take science than you have to study very-very hard for IIT or NEET in that, students almost forget to emjoy college life and to make memories with friends and be someone's important part in life.
        After that 12th result come's and than student's are judged on the base of their mark's. Than few people end their life and few people goes under depression and regret all decision's they have taken in life. School never teaches us how to start
        business. They just teach us how to work under other people. After that degree college's start's and then more 3 to 4 year's. Student's who havent decided yet, feels more useless because at that time, people of same age are earning, or are focused
        what they should do in life.

    <p>Another Brick In the Wall means just they have got shape with no feelings, no aim's and dont know what to do in life because of our education system. This is the reason to keep the name as Another brick in the wall.</p>
